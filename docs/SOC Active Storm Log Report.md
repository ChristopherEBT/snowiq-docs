## Active Storm Log <a name="-Active-Storm-Log"></a>

The Active Storm Log page is an Event Log that allows Admin users a closer look into the actions, the users, and timestamps of the actions for the current active Event. As seen below, the log shows the time the action occurred in the system, what the action was, and who performed it (user name or system). Actions may include creating an Assignment, activating a new Phase for a Depot, or changing the status of a Driver.
