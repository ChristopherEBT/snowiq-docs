After that App will download and synchronize all the assignments existing in the system, including planned assignments from future not activated phases.

This allows Driver to take control of his assignments, but due to lack of connection, we recommend to coordinate work and communicate with Inspector/Supervisor by radio.

After detached mode is turned off, the App will upload and synchronize all the progress with the system.
