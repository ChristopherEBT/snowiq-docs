Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on SNOWiQ web site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. Please ensure that you check the applicable Terms every time you use our Site so that you understand which Terms apply. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of SNOWiQ after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted.

Accordingly, those persons who choose to access SNOWiQ from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

SNOWiQ is not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use SNOWiQ.

SNOWiQ is intended for users who are at least 18 years old. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to use SNOWiQ.
